[Anura Kumara Dissanayake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anura_Kumara_Dissanayake) was elected as the next president of Sri Lanka, as I predicted in my previous post about him. 
This is a late post, but more people have changed their minds about him positively since his election and after he made some good changes. People initially thought he would be somewhat rough or fearful due to his somewhat Marxist/Leftist past.
Hope for the best! üëê‚ö°Ô∏è
