Previously, I mentioned that I sold some amount of $HMSTR in the premarket and was looking for a good profit in return. Not gonna lie, I made a very good amount of money from that and I'm really happy that it turned out to be a shitcoin. Lol. :smiley:

By the way, I saw that many people reported that Hamster lost their users after the official launch due to the disappointment they experienced. Frankly, I don't blame them.

After that chaos, my next goal is the BLUM Airdrop. Premarkets are already opening on
couple of exchanges. 
I used BingX to sell some at around $0.01 per 1 Blum. Currently, no one can predict the token value besides the community value. From my perspective, the community is very healthy. However, there is no information about the token supply sizes, etc. So it's just blind predictions without tokenomics.


If you're only doing TG airdrops, keep an eye on BLUM, CEXP, and KUCOIN airdrops (Exchange-Based/Backed Airdrops) üòÉ‚ù§Ô∏è

** These TG tapping bots are a bunch of bull üí© in my opinion. Try to engage with Testnet and Mainnet communities. -- It may be boring, but that'll make you rich.
